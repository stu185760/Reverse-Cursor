## 🤔 Current Status Check

**Is your current v0 app:**
- ✅ Using Supabase database? (data persists after refresh)
- ❌ Using localStorage? (data lost after clear cache)

**Check by:**
1. Open your v0 app
2. Open browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage
3. If you see data there → it's using localStorage
4. If Supabase → you see data in Supabase dashboard

---

## 🔍 What Happens Next?

### If v0 app uses Supabase ✅
**Good news:** Once you deploy, your data comes with you!
- All users, ads, messages preserved
- Just deploy and connect
- Everything works immediately

### If v0 app uses localStorage ❌
**We need to migrate:** The code needs updates
- Replace localStorage with Supabase API calls
- I can do this automatically
- Takes ~30 minutes of coding
- Your data will need to be re-created OR
- We can build a migration script

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### ✅ SAFE - These are already gitignored:
- `.env.local` (your secrets)
- `node_modules`
- `.next` build folder

### ⚠️ Before you push:
Run this to make sure no secrets are committed:
```bash
git status
# Make sure you don't see .env or .env.local
```

### 💰 Costs (Spoiler: FREE!)
- **Vercel:** Free tier (perfect for this)
- **Supabase:** Already have it
- **GitHub:** Free public repos
- **Total:** $0/month
