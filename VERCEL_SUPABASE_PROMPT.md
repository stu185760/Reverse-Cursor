Hi! I need help with my Next.js 15 app that's already connected to Supabase.

CURRENT SITUATION:
- App is deployed on Vercel: v0-deploy-next-js-supabase
- Supabase connection already configured (environment variables set)
- Supabase project: supabase-blue-umbrella (from v0.dev)
- Repository: stu185760/Reverse-Cursor
- Framework: Next.js 15 with App Router

MY APP:
A reverse marketplace where:
- Customers post requirements (ads)
- Vendors browse and respond with quotes
- Real-time messaging between users
- Three user roles: Customer, Vendor, Admin

SUPABASE SETUP STATUS:
âœ… Environment variables configured (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)
âœ… Database schema exists (profiles, ads, classifieds, quotes, messages, reviews)
âœ… Supabase client files created (lib/supabase/client.ts, lib/supabase/server.ts)
âœ… Authentication enabled in Supabase dashboard

CURRENT ISSUE:
The app is currently using localStorage for data storage instead of Supabase database. I need to:

1. Verify Supabase connection is working
2. Update authentication redirect URLs with my Vercel domain
3. Confirm data is persisting to Supabase instead of localStorage

WHAT I NEED HELP WITH:

1. POST-DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION:
   - What's my Vercel deployment URL?
   - How do I add it to Supabase redirect URLs?
   - Where exactly do I update this in Supabase dashboard?

2. IMAGE/FILE STORAGE SETUP:
   - Need to store user-uploaded photos for ads and classifieds
   - How do I set up Supabase Storage buckets?
   - What's the best way to handle image uploads from Next.js?
   - Should images be stored as URLs in database tables?
   - Need automatic image optimization and CDN delivery

3. DATABASE TABLES FOR ADS & PHOTOS:
   - Need tables to store: ads, classifieds, user profiles, messages, quotes
   - Each ad/classified should support multiple photos
   - Store user info: id, name, email, role (customer/vendor/admin), profile photo
   - Store ad data: title, description, category, location, budget, images[], status
   - Make it easy for users to upload and view photos
   - Proper foreign key relationships

4. CONNECTION VERIFICATION:
   - How can I test if my app is successfully connected to Supabase?
   - How do I verify data is being saved to Supabase database?
   - Any tools or logs I should check?

5. AUTHENTICATION FLOW:
   - My app has auth pages (login, signup) but they might still be using mock auth
   - How do I verify Supabase Auth is actually being used?
   - What should I check in the browser/network tab?

SUPABASE DASHBOARD ACCESS:
âœ… I have access to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
âœ… Project: supabase-blue-umbrella

Please guide me through the post-deployment steps to ensure everything is properly connected and working!
