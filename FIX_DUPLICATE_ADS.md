# ðŸ”§ FIX DUPLICATE ADS ISSUE

## Problem
You're seeing 2-3 ads when you only posted 1 ad because your browser has **old data** stored from previous sessions.

2. **Go to Application Tab**
   - Click "Application" at the top

3. **Find Local Storage**

   - Click `http://localhost:3000`

4. **Clear Data**
   - Right-click on `easycustomized-db` â†’ "Delete"
   - OR click "Clear All" button at the top

5. **Refresh Page**
   - Press `F5` or `Ctrl + R`

### **OPTION 2: Clear in Console (Fastest)**

   - Press `F12`
   - Click "Console" tab

   localStorage.clear()

### **OPTION 3: Hard Refresh (Quick Try)**

## ðŸ“Š After Clearing

You should see:
- âœ… **Only 1 sample ad** (Wedding Jewelry)
- âœ… When you post new ad â†’ 2 ads total (sample + yours)
- âœ… Clean, fresh start!

---

## ðŸŽ¯ WHY THIS HAPPENS

- Browser saves data in `localStorage`
- Old ads from yesterday still there
- Clearing browser doesn't clear `localStorage`
- Need to manually clear it

---

## ðŸ’¡ FUTURE: Use Export/Import Feature

**To prevent data loss:**
1. Switch to **Admin** role
2. Go to `/admin` page
3. Click **"Export Data (Backup)"** button
4. Save the JSON file
5. Now you can clear localStorage safely!
6. Import the backup when needed

---

## âœ… VERIFY IT'S FIXED

After clearing localStorage:
1. Refresh page (`F5`)
2. Go to "Browse Ads" page
3. You should see **only 1 ad** (the sample Wedding Jewelry ad)
4. Post a new ad
5. Now you'll see **2 ads** (sample + yours) âœ“

**That's it! Your duplicate ads issue will be fixed.** ðŸŽ‰
