### 3. Authentication Setup

## 🌐 Your Deployed App

**Live URL**: https://v0-pilot-run-soft-launch-ec.vercel.app

This app:
- ✅ Has all Supabase environment variables
- ✅ Can authenticate users
- ✅ Can upload images to Supabase Storage
- ✅ Can save data to Supabase database

## 🚀 Next Steps (To Fully Connect Your App)

Your **Supabase backend is ready**, but your **app code** might still be using `localStorage`. To fully migrate:

### Option A: Use the Deployed App (v0)
Your v0-deployed app at `https://v0-pilot-run-soft-launch-ec.vercel.app` might already be using Supabase. Try:

1. Go to: https://v0-pilot-run-soft-launch-ec.vercel.app/auth/login
2. Create an account
3. Post an ad or classified
4. Check Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor to see if data appears

If data appears in Supabase, you're done! ✅

### Option B: Update Local Code to Use Supabase

If the deployed app is still using localStorage, we need to:

1. **Create Auth Pages** (login, signup, logout)
2. **Replace localStorage with Supabase API calls**:
   - `lib/local-db.ts` → migrate all functions to use Supabase client
   - Update all components to use Supabase queries
3. **Implement Image Uploads** to Supabase Storage
4. **Test locally**, then push to GitHub
5. **Redeploy to Vercel**

## 🔍 Quick Test

Run this in **Supabase SQL Editor** to verify everything works:

```sql
-- Test query: List all tables
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE';

-- Expected result: 6 tables (profiles, ads, classifieds, quotes, messages, reviews)
```
