# 🔧 Fix Database Schema NOW

## ❗ PROBLEM:
The v0 code expects a **different database schema** than what we had before!

**What's different:**
- v0 uses `ad_images` as a **separate table** (not an array in ads)
- v0 uses `profile_photo_url` (not `avatar_url`)
- v0 uses `recipient_id` (not `receiver_id`)
- v0 uses simpler ad status: `open | closed | in_progress`

## ✅ SOLUTION:
Run the new migration script that matches v0's schema **exactly**.

## 🚀 STEP 1: Run SQL Migration

### 1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/atqbwkdtgvkavcuwolxo/sql
```

### 2. Click "New Query"

### 3. Copy & Paste This Entire Script:
👉 **Open file**: `supabase/migrations/002_v0_schema.sql`

Copy the **entire contents** and paste into Supabase SQL editor.

### 4. Click "Run" (or press Ctrl+Enter)

### 5. You Should See:
```
🎉🎉🎉 V0 SCHEMA CREATED! 🎉🎉🎉
```

## 🖼️ STEP 2: Create Storage Buckets

### 1. Go to Supabase Storage
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/atqbwkdtgvkavcuwolxo/storage/buckets
```

### 2. Create First Bucket
- Click "New bucket"
- Name: `ad-images`
- Public bucket: ✅ **YES** (check the box!)
- Click "Create"

### 3. Create Second Bucket
- Click "New bucket" again
- Name: `profile-photos`
- Public bucket: ✅ **YES** (check the box!)
- Click "Create"

---

## 🧪 STEP 3: Test Again

### 1. Go to Your Live App
```
https://v0-pilot-run-soft-launch-ec.vercel.app
```

### 2. Sign Up (with a NEW email!)
- Name: Test User
- Email: test2@test.com (use a different email!)
- Password: test1234
- Select: "I need services"

### 3. Create an Ad
- Dashboard → Create Ad
- Fill form
- Upload image
- Submit

### 4. Check Supabase
Go to Table Editor:
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/atqbwkdtgvkavcuwolxo/editor
```

**Check these tables:**
- `profiles` - Should have your new user ✅
- `ads` - Should have your ad ✅
- `ad_images` - Should have uploaded image ✅

---

## 📊 What Changed:

### **Old Schema** (didn't match v0):
```sql
ads {
  images: TEXT[]  ❌ (array in ads table)
  avatar_url: TEXT ❌
  status: 'active' ❌
}

messages {
  receiver_id: UUID ❌
}
```

### **New Schema** (matches v0):
```sql
ads {
  -- No images field here
}

ad_images {
  ad_id: UUID ✅ (separate table!)
  image_url: TEXT ✅
}

profiles {
  profile_photo_url: TEXT ✅
}

messages {
  recipient_id: UUID ✅
}

ads.status: 'open' | 'closed' | 'in_progress' ✅
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Steps Summary:

1. ✅ Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. ✅ Paste `002_v0_schema.sql` contents
3. ✅ Run it
4. ✅ Create 2 storage buckets (ad-images, profile-photos)
5. ✅ Test app again with NEW email

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting:

### SQL Error?
- Make sure you copied the **entire file**
- Check there are no errors in the SQL editor
- Send me the error message

### Storage Error?
- Make sure buckets are marked as **PUBLIC**
- Check bucket names are exactly: `ad-images` and `profile-photos`

### Still Empty?
- Use a **NEW email** to sign up (old data might be cached)
- Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console
- Try creating ad
- Send me console errors
