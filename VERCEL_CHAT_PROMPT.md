## ðŸŽ¯ PASTE THIS INTO VERCEL CHAT:

```
Hi! I need help deploying my Next.js 15 app and connecting it to my existing Supabase database.

SITUATION:
- Repository: https://github.com/stu185760/Reverse-Cursor
- Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- Database: Supabase (already set up from v0.dev project)
- Goal: Deploy to Vercel and connect to existing Supabase instance

WHAT I NEED HELP WITH:

1. IMPORTING MY REPOSITORY
   - Repository name: Reverse-Cursor
   - GitHub username: stu185760
   - Branch: main

2. CONFIGURING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
   I have these three Supabase credentials from my existing project:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   
   How do I add these to my Vercel project? Which environments should I enable (Production/Preview/Development)?

3. BUILD SETTINGS
   - Build Command: npm run build (is this correct?)
   - Output Directory: .next (is this correct?)
   - Install Command: npm install (is this correct?)
   - Node.js Version: Should I specify a version?

4. SUPABASE AUTHENTICATION SETUP
   After deployment, I need to:
   - Update Supabase redirect URLs with my Vercel domain
   - Configure authentication callback routes
   
   What Vercel URL should I use for the redirect URLs?

5. DEPLOYMENT
   - Should I deploy immediately or configure settings first?
   - How do I redeploy if I need to change environment variables?

6. TESTING
   What should I check after deployment to ensure Supabase connection works?

ADDITIONAL INFO:
- This is a reverse marketplace app (customers post requirements, vendors respond)
- Uses Supabase Auth for authentication
- Has PWA support configured
- Repository is public/private [specify which]

Please guide me through the deployment process step-by-step!
```
