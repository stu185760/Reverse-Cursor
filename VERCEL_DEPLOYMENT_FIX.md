# 🔧 Vercel Deployment Fix

## ❗ PROBLEM:
The live site is showing **OLD code**, not our new v0 integration!

This is why data isn't saving to Supabase - the old code uses localStorage, not Supabase.

---

## ✅ QUICK FIX:

### **Option 1: Promote Latest Deployment** (2 minutes)

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard:
   ```
   https://vercel.com/dashboard
   ```

2. Click your project (probably "Reverse-Cursor" or similar)

3. Go to **"Deployments"** tab

4. Find the **latest deployment** (top of list)
   - Should be from today
   - Should say "Built from GitHub"
   - Commit message: "fix: Add v0-compatible database schema"

5. Click the **3 dots** (⋮) next to it

6. Click **"Promote to Production"**

7. Wait 30 seconds

8. Refresh your site: https://v0-pilot-run-soft-launch-ec.vercel.app

---

### **Option 2: Force Redeploy** (3 minutes)

If Option 1 doesn't work:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project

2. Click **"Deployments"** tab

3. Click **latest deployment** to open it

4. Click **"Redeploy"** button

5. Select **"Use existing Build Cache"** → NO (uncheck)

6. Click **"Redeploy"**

7. Wait 2-3 minutes for build

8. Refresh your site

---

## 🧪 How to Verify It Worked:

After promoting/redeploying:

1. Go to: https://v0-pilot-run-soft-launch-ec.vercel.app/auth/sign-up

2. **OLD CODE** shows:
   - "I am a" dropdown
   - "Repeat Password" field
   - "Check your email" after signup

3. **NEW CODE** shows:
   - "What brings you here?" with radio buttons
   - NO "Repeat Password" field  
   - Goes straight to dashboard after signup

---

## 📸 What to Look For:

### **In Vercel Dashboard:**

Look for this in Deployments:
```
✅ Ready (Latest)
   fix: Add v0-compatible database schema
   69ee74d
   main branch
   [Your time]
```

**If this deployment is NOT marked as "Production":**
- Click the ⋮ menu
- Click "Promote to Production"

---

## 🎯 After Fix:

Once the new code is deployed:

1. Sign up with NEW email
2. Should go straight to dashboard (no email confirmation)
3. Create ad
4. Check Supabase → `ads` table
5. **Ad should be there!** ✅

**Do this now and let me know!** 🚀
