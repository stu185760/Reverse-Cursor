## 🔧 **CONNECTION STATUS**

### **Current Status:** ⚠️ **NOT CONNECTED**

When attempting to use TestSprite tools, receiving:
```
{"error":"Not connected"}
```

This typically means:
1. MCP server hasn't been started yet
2. Connection needs to be established
3. Cursor needs to be restarted to load MCP servers

## 🚀 **HOW TO ACTIVATE TESTSPRITE**

### **Method 1: Restart Cursor** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
```
1. Close Cursor completely
2. Reopen Cursor
3. MCP servers auto-start on launch
4. TestSprite should connect automatically
```

### **Method 2: Manual Connection**
```
