- Fixed session exchange

### 3. Updated Signup Flow

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Disable Email Confirmation in Supabase

**This is causing the email link to hang!**

### Steps:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**: `supabase-blue-umbrella`
3. **Go to**: Authentication → Email Auth → **Settings**
4. Find: **"Enable email confirmations"**
5. **Toggle it OFF** (disable it)
6. **Save Changes**

### Why?
- When email confirmation is enabled, users must click the email link before logging in
- The email link is hanging/slow to load
- For development/testing, it's easier to disable this
- You can re-enable it later for production
