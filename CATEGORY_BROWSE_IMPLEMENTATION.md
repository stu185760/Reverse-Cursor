**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Feature:** Category-specific browse page with classified ads and inline post form  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Implemented a new category browse experience that combines vendor classified ads (featured products) with an inline customer request form, creating a dual-purpose page that serves both browsing and posting needs.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Dynamic Category Page
**File:** `app/categories/[categorySlug]/page.tsx`

- Dynamic route for all product categories
- Server-side generation of static params for all categories
- 60/40 split layout (classifieds left, post form right)
- Responsive design (stacked on mobile, side-by-side on desktop)
- Back navigation to homepage
- "How It Works" info section

### 2. Category Classifieds Display
**File:** `components/category-classifieds.tsx`

**Features:**
- Grid display of vendor classified ads filtered by category
- Product cards with images, title, description, price
- Image gallery preview (shows "+X more" for multiple images)
- Hover effects and transitions
- Empty state when no products available
- Category badge and product count
- "View Details" link for each product
- Responsive grid (2 columns desktop, 1 column mobile)

**Styling:**
- Dark theme with glass-morphism cards
- Neon cyan (#00FFFF) accents
- Smooth hover animations
- Consistent with existing design system

### 3. Inline Post Form
**File:** `components/category-post-section.tsx`

**Features:**
- Sticky card on desktop (stays visible while scrolling)
- Pre-filled category from URL parameter
- Simplified posting form with essential fields:
  - Title (with character counter)
  - Description (textarea with character counter)
  - Budget range (min/max in INR)
  - Location selector
- Real-time validation with error messages
- Duplicate submission prevention (`isSubmitting` state)
- Input sanitization using existing validation library
- Success message and redirect to ad detail page

**User Experience:**
- Clear visual hierarchy with purple (#7A00FF) theme
- Contextual placeholder text
- Character counters for all text fields
- Disabled state while submitting
- Helpful description mentioning the category

### 4. Database Helper Functions
**File:** `lib/local-db.ts`

Added two new functions:
```typescript
// Get classifieds filtered by category
export function getClassifiedsByCategory(categorySlug: string): Classified[]

// Get all active classifieds
export function getAllClassifieds(): Classified[]
```

### 5. Updated Navigation
**File:** `components/category-showcase.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Changed category card links from `/post-ad?category=X` to `/categories/X`
- Updated button text from "Post Request" to "Explore & Post"
- Added slug property to category data structure
- Maintained all existing styling and animations
